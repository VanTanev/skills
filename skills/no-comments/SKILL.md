# No comments

Spawn Comment Sicko. Act on accepted findings.

Authoring agents defend comments. Defer to Comment Sicko's fresh perspective.

## Scope

Use the caller's files or diff. Otherwise pin the fixed point the caller named (a commit SHA, branch name, tag, `HEAD~5`, etc.); without one, ask in chat.

Capture the diff once: `git diff <fixed-point>...HEAD` (three-dot, so the comparison is against the merge-base). Confirm the fixed point resolves (`git rev-parse <fixed-point>`) and the diff is non-empty before spawning; a bad ref or empty diff fails here, not inside the Sicko.

## Steps

1. Read `references/comment-sicko.md`. Spawn `Agent` with `subagent_type: "general-purpose"` and that file verbatim as the prompt, followed by the scope.
2. Inspect its report and diff. Reject application-code edits, scope escapes, exception-protected deletions, misstated `MUST KILL` reasons, and flags that treat kept intentional code as guilty. Reshape flags on our-code surprises stay actionable. Do not restore those comments. A keep survives only with proof it is about something we cannot change. Audit missed scoped lint and TypeScript suppressions. Correctness or safety suppressions stay actionable `MUST KILL`s. Restore deletions only with exact exceptions and scoped proof. Before accepting thin `IMPORTANT` or `do not remove` kills or keeps, run the Sicko's Trace on their symbol. If a kill is ambiguous, do not restore. If a keep is refuted or still ambiguous, delete it. Revert and rerun one rejected report with the failure named. Reject a second, report it open, and fail `/no-comments`.
3. Fix trivial accepted flags directly by deleting a dead path, dropping a parameter, or using the real API. If any fix needs a shape, sketch once for the accepted set and surrounding code: write the caller's usage first, then types and signatures with `not implemented` bodies. Sketch two structurally distinct shapes and keep the one that hides more behind a smaller public surface. Stop at the sketch. Step 4 implements.
4. Implement the smallest root-cause fix in scope against the sketch. Remove every named workaround. Fix the cause where it lives: a guard that silences a symptom is not a fix. Redesign as if the requirement had existed from day one. If the root cause is out of scope, land the smallest in-scope fix and report the rest open. Neither rule authorizes widening the fence nor fixing instances outside it.
5. Constraint comments say `do not remove`, `do not change wording`, or `talk to X before changing`. Leave keeps about things we cannot change. Offer the cheapest in-scope type, runtime, test, or CI lint. Ask in chat and wait for approval. Unattended runs require caller pre-approval. If approved, encode then delete. Otherwise delete, report the constraint open, and sketch out-of-scope work.
6. Report the deletion count, restored comments, reruns, sketch, fixes, encoding offers, encodings, unenforced constraints, and other open work.
